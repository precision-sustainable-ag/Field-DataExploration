# Field-DataExploration

**Description**:
This repo is the central hub for the initial phase of data exploration and assessment of a project aimed at comprehensive data management and processing of the PSA Field data. It focuses on addressing the initial backlog of images and metadata while emphasizing a deep understanding of our existing Field images.

2. **Data Visualization and Status Reporting**: Features scripts and resources for creating visual representations of the data's current status and contents. This aids in identifying patterns, anomalies, and key areas requiring attention.

3. **Metadata Quality Review and Image Sampling**: Offers guidelines and tools for inspecting metadata accuracy and completeness, along with methods for performing quality checks on image samples.

4. **Data Exploration and Reporting**: Includes exploratory data analysis tools to understand the characteristics and structure of the dataset. It also encompasses reporting mechanisms for documenting findings and progress.

5. **Data Organization and Issue Resolution**: Provides strategies and scripts for identifying immediate dataset issues, along with solutions to these challenges.
